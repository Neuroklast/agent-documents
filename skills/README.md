# Skills — Index

Task-specific skills (one `SKILL.md` per folder, Agent Skills spec). Load a
skill only when its `description` matches the task
([core/context-budget.md](../core/context-budget.md)).

| [plan-first](plan-first/SKILL.md) | Non-trivial task: plan before coding |
| [tdd-extraction](tdd-extraction/SKILL.md) | Bug/feature: derive the failing test first |
| [rest-guidelines](rest-guidelines/SKILL.md) | API design/review (REST wire format) |
