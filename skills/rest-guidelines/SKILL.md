# Skill — REST Guidelines

Self-contained subset of the Zalando RESTful API Guidelines. Authoritative for this collection.

## Resource naming

- kebab-case paths, plural nouns: `/invoice-line-items`.
- No verbs in paths. Actions that are genuinely processes: noun them (`/imports`, `/exports`).
- No trailing slashes. Path segments lowercase.
- IDs: UUIDs/opaque strings. NEVER sequential integers in public APIs.

## JSON

- Property names snake_case: `created_at`, `line_items`.
- Arrays are plural (`items`). Empty array, not `null`, for empty lists.
- Timestamps RFC 3339 UTC (`2026-09-16T12:00:00Z`); dates `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Enums: lowercase snake strings, stable forever.
- NEVER `null` for missing list/collection fields.

## Methods

| Method | Semantics | Success |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | safe, cacheable where applicable | 200 |
| POST | create | 201 + `Location` |
| PUT | full replace | 200/204 |
| PATCH | partial merge | 200/204 |
| DELETE | idempotent | 204 |

- Long-running operations: 202 + status resource.
- Idempotency key (header) for payment and retryable create endpoints.

## Status codes

- 400 malformed, 401 unauthenticated, 403 unauthorized, 404 unknown, 409 conflict, 422 semantically invalid, 429 rate limited, 500 server error, 503 dependency down.
- 429 MUST carry retry information (`Retry-After`).
- NEVER 200 with an error body.

## Errors — problem+json

```json
{
  "type": "https://example.com/problems/validation",
  "title": "Validation failed",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "line_items[0].quantity must be >= 1",
  "instance": "/api/v1/invoices"
}
```

- Content-Type: `application/problem+json`.
- NEVER stack traces, SQL, or internal identifiers.
- Validation errors SHOULD include field-level detail.

## Pagination

- Cursor-based by default; opaque cursor (`next_cursor`), never page numbers in public contracts.
- Default page size ~50, max ~200; enforce server-side.
- Response shape: `items`, `next_cursor` (nullable), optional `total` only when cheap.

## Versioning

- URL versioning `/api/v1/*`.
- Additive-only within a version: new optional fields/endpoints OK; renames/removals/type changes → new version.
- Deprecation announced in docs + headers before removal.

## Auth

- Every non-public endpoint authenticates + authorizes ([../../backend/auth.md](../../backend/auth.md)).
- Tenant/ownership derived from the session, never from client-supplied IDs alone.
- Public endpoints: rate-limited, column-whitelisted.

## OpenAPI — definition of done

- [ ] Paths, request/response schemas, status codes reflected in the OpenAPI spec.
- [ ] Spec generated from code where possible; NEVER hand-edit generated YAML.
- [ ] Contract check (`verify:api-contracts`) green.
- [ ] An endpoint without spec coverage is not done.
